# CMOS-Inverter-Design-Using-Skywater-130nm-Technology-Node
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a CMOS inverter using the Skywater 130nm technology node. The project includes the creation of NMOS and PMOS devices, generation of I-V curves, voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) analysis, and analog layout using Magic VLSI. Below is a detailed explanation of each step.
